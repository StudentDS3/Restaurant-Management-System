# Restaurant-Management-System
**Introduction**

Restaurant Management System built using python language, which is console based application using text files to store different food menus and users information.
Which has different features like authentication,authorization,registartion. Restaurant manager(Admin) wants to perform the basic actions such as 
adding a food menu, remove  and display it. Clients  can also login and perform actions like display a food menu,  order it and pay online.

**Handling**

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a virtual environment

3. Install pybuilder

4. pip install pybuilder

5. Build the project -- pyb 

6. Run the project using any IDE as it's console based application.

#### Contents
**1) UML Diagrams.**

Unified Modeling Language is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.

Following are the UML diagrams for Restaurant-Management-System.

[Use case Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System) 

The purpose of use case diagram is to capture the dynamic aspect of a system.
Items involved are 1)Functionalities to be represented as use case 2)Actors 3)Relationships among the use cases and actors.

[Activity Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System)

Activity diagram is basically a flowchart to represent the flow from one activity to another activity. The activity can be described as an operation of the system.
The control flow is drawn from one operation to another. This flow can be sequential, branched, or concurrent. Activity diagrams deal with all type of flow control by using different elements such as fork, join, etc
      
[Class Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System)

 It represents the static view of an application. Class diagram is not only used for visualizing, describing, and documenting different aspects of a system but also for constructing executable code of the software application.
 Class diagram shows a collection of classes, interfaces, associations, collaborations, and constraints. It is also known as a structural diagram.

**2) The domain driven design (DDD) Of Restaurant Management System(RMS)**

The domain driven design approach is used for complex needs, connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts. It puts the focus on the problem domain and basically helps identify the architecture and inform about the mechanics that the software needs to replicate.To create a Restaurant Management System,I have a good understanding of what restaurant booking is all about, and the domain of Food Ordering System .
There 4 main DDD common terms

   1. Context: The setting in which a word or statement appears that determines its meaning. Statements about a model can only be understood in a context.
               
   2. Model: A system of abstractions that describes selected aspects of a domain and can be used to solve problems related to that domain.
   
   3. Ubiquitous Language: A language structured around the domain model and used by all team members to connect all the activities of the team with the software.
                          
   4. Bounded Context: A description of a boundary (typically a subsystem, or the work of a specific team) within which a particular model is defined and applicable.
                       (example: Booking Managemnet System, User management, admin management, Transcation management, Employee Management, food menu Management)
