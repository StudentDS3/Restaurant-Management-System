**Introduction**

Restaurant Management System is a console-based application that uses text files to store multiple food menus and user information. It is written in the Python programming language.
Which includes features such as authentication, authorization, and registartion. The restaurant manager (Admin) want to execute basic functions such as adding, removing, and displaying food menus. Clients can also log in and execute tasks such as seeing a menu, ordering meals, and paying for it online.

**Handling**

1. Clone the repository

2. Create a virtual environment

3. Install pybuilder

4. pip install pybuilder

5. Build the project -- pyb 

6. Run the project using any IDE as it's console based application.

**1) UML Diagrams.**

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental modeling language in the field of software engineering that aims to provide a standardized approach to represent a system's design.

The UML diagrams for the Restaurant-Management-System are shown below.

[Use case Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System) 

The objective of a use case diagram is to capture a system's dynamic nature.
1)Functionalities to be stated as a use case are involved. 2)Actors 3)Interactions between use cases and actors.

[Activity Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System)

An activity diagram is a flowchart that depicts the flow of information from one activity to the next. The activity can be described as a system operation.
From one activity to the next, the control flow is depicted. This flow can be sequential, branched, or concurrent. Different elements such as fork, join, and others are used in activity diagrams to cope with various types of flow control.
      
[Class Diagram](https://github.com/StudentDS3/Restaurant-Management-System)

 Class diagram shows a collection of classes, interfaces, associations, collaborations, and constraints. It is also known as a structural diagram.
 A class diagram depicts an application's static view. It is used not only for visualizing, describing, and documenting many parts of a system, but also for creating executable code for a software program.
A collection of classes, interfaces, associations, collaborations, and constraints are shown in a class diagram. A structural diagram is another name for it.

**2) The domain driven design (DDD) Of Restaurant Management System(RMS)**

For complicated requirements, the domain driven design technique is utilized, which connects the implementation to a changing model of the key business principles. It focuses on the issue domain and essentially serves in the identification of the architecture as well as the processes that the program must reproduce. I have a decent understanding of what restaurant booking is all about, as well as the domain of Food Ordering System, which I will use to construct a Restaurant Management System.

There are four main DDD terms :

   1. Context: A word's or statement's meaning is determined by the context in which it appears. Only in context can statements regarding a model be understood.
               
   2. Model: A system of abstractions that can be utilized to solve problems in a domain by describing selected parts of it.
   
   3. Ubiquitous Language: A language based on the domain model that is used by all team members to connect all of the team's activities to the software.
                          
   4. Bounded Context: A boundary (usually a subsystem or the activities of a certain team) within which a given model is specified and applicable.
                       (example: Booking Managemnet System, User management, admin management, Transcation management, Employee Management, food menu Management)

**3) SonarCloud Metrics.**

SonarCloud is an online service that detects bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells in Pull Requests and across code repositories, allowing developers to improve their workflow by ensuring consistent code quality.

**1. SonarCloud Reliability Metrics:**

Reliability metrics are used to express the software product's reliability in quantitative terms. It examines new bugs such as number of news bugs issues in source code.

**2. SonarCloud Security Metrics:**

Security metrics uncover vulnerabilities and new weaknesses in source code.

**3. SonarCloud Duplication Metrics:**

Duplication Metrics uses line duplication, files duplication and  blocks duplication  metrics to cover code duplication in the RMS project code.
